# Hello! ðŸŽ‰ 

I'm Luke, a software engineer in Nashville, TN. I'm passionate about **front-end development**, **product analytics**, **music**, **novel writing**, **ministry** & **building digital products** that solve problems and help people. I love working at Ramsey Solutions on apps that give people Hope. Check out our [Ramsey In-House](https://www.ramseyinhouse.com/) site, and let me know what you think!
